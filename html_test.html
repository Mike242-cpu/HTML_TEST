<body><h1>First HTML website creation</h1></body>

    Why am I doing this?
    <ul>
        <li>It's fun</li>
        <li>It runs good</li>
        <li>And looks easy</li>
        <li>面白い</li>
    </ul>
    ... I also need the practice.
    <p>I look to forward to gaining experience in creating a webpage. I intend to also develop skills in CSS and javascript.
        In any case I hope to have fun with this project and hopefully its easier than japanese. 
        日本語が難しよ。
